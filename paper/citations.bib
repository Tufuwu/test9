  abstract = "Arteria is an automation system aimed at sequencing core
              facilities. It is built on existing open source technologies,
              with a modular design allowing for a community-driven effort to
              create plug-and-play micro-services. Herein we describe the
              Arteria system and elaborate on the underlying conceptual
              framework. The Arteria system breaks down into three conceptual
              levels; orchestration, process and execution. At the
              orchestration level it utilizes an event-based model of
              automation. It models processes, e.g. the steps involved in
              processing sequencing data, as workflows and executes these in a
              micro-service based environment. This creates a system which is
              both flexible and scalable. The Arteria Project code is available
              as open source software at http://www.github.com/arteria-project.",

  abstract    = "With ever-increasing amounts of data being produced by
                 next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, the requirements
                 placed on supporting e-infrastructures have grown. In this
                 work, we provide recommendations based on the collective
                 experiences from participants in the EU COST Action SeqAhead
                 for the tasks of data preprocessing, upstream processing, data
                 delivery, and downstream analysis, as well as long-term
                 storage and archiving. We cover demands on computational and
                 storage resources, networks, software stacks, automation of
                 analysis, education, and also discuss emerging trends in the
                 field. E-infrastructures for NGS require substantial effort to
                 set up and maintain over time, and with sequencing
                 technologies and best practices for data analysis evolving
                 rapidly it is important to prioritize both processing capacity
                 and e-infrastructure flexibility when making strategic
                 decisions to support the data analysis demands of tomorrow.
                 Due to increasingly demanding technical requirements we
                 recommend that e-infrastructure development and maintenance be
                 handled by a professional service unit, be it internal or
                 external to the organization, and emphasis should be placed on
