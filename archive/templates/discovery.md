# Protocol name

Describe the discovery protocol at a high level here.

# Design and specification

Add links to specifications and design docs.

# Presentation API functionality

Describe how the discovery protocol meets
[functional requirements for the Presentation API](../requirements.md#presentation-display-availability)
for presentation display availability.

# Remote Playback API functionality

Describe how the discovery protocol meets functional requirements for the Remote
Playback API.

**TODO:** Fill in when Remote Playback equirements are known.
See [Issue #3](https://github.com/webscreens/openscreenprotocol/issues/3).

# Reliability

Data describing reliability in different network requirements.

# Latency of device discovery / device removal

Data on the latency of discovering a new presentation display added to the
network, or discovering that a display was disconnected from the network.

# Network and power efficiency

Any data about power and network overhead.

# Ease of implementation / deployment

Including availability of open source implementations.

# IPv4 and IPv6 support

# Hardware requirements

The minimum specifications needed to use the discovery protocol, and whether
the devices in [Sample Device Specifications](../device_specs.md) are
sufficient.

# Standardization status

Describe standardization process, timeline, and link to working group's IPR
policy, if any.

# Privacy

What device or application information is exposed to network observers by the
discovery protocol?

# Security

Describe any impact on the security of the controlling user agent or
presentation display, including threats and potential mitigations.

# User experience

Describe any specific impact on
meeting [user experience requirements](../requirements.md#req-nf3-ux) not covered
by the points above.

# Notes
