Open Zaak was originally created in late 2019 based on the reference
implementation of the VNG standards for "API's voor Zaakgericht werken".

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Zaak that much
better:

    Alex de Landgraaf <alex@maykinmedia.nl>
    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Steven Bal <steven@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    All municipalities who initiated the project: Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
    Utrecht, Tilburg, Arnhem, Haarlem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Delft and a
    combination of Hoorn, Medemblik, Stede Broec, Drechteland, Enkhuizen (SED)

    Dimpact for their excellent guidance and support.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
