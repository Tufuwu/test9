This file lists all people who have contributed to the RPySOM VM.

SOM was originally implemented at the University of Aarhus (Denmark) in
2001/2002. The implementation of SOM was done by Jakob Roland Andersen, Kasper
Verdich Lund, Lars Bak, Mads Torgersen, and Ulrik Pagh Schultz. They also
wrote the original versions of the SOM Smalltalk libraries, test suites, and
benchmarks, that are (in extended versions) bundled with SOM.

SOM was used by Michael Haupt in courses on virtual machines at Lancaster
University and Technische Universitaet Darmstadt (Germany) in VM courses in
2006. During that time, some changes were applied to SOM by Michael Haupt and
Sebastian Kanthak.

PySOM is a port by Stefan Marr of SOM's Java implementation. Later it became
RPySOM by porting it to RPython, and then it was changed from using a bytecode
interpreter to use an AST-based interpreter to become RTruffleSOM.
RTruffleSOM contains contributions from Carl Friedrich Bolz and Tobias Pape.
In the now current version, it merges RPySOM and RTruffleSOM to be in a single
repository, but preserving the option to use either AST or bytecode-based
interpretation.
