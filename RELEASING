Releasing an SDK Version
========================

Create a PR which updates the changelog and bumps version

Reviewer merges, then checks out `master` and runs `make release`. This will
push to pypi and tag the current commit

Reviewer pushes the tag to GitHub and goes to the releases page [1] to write up
the release, using the changelog
