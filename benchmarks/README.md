# Open Screen Benchmarks

These are "design documents" describing benchmarks that collect data on the
performance and efficiency of Open Screen protocol components.  The specific
data will answer questions about efficiency, latency and reliability in the
evaluation templates for [discovery](../templates/discovery.md)
and [transport](../templates/transport.md).

## Benchmarks

The following designs have been submitted:
- [Discovery Protocol Benchmark Design](discovery.md)
- [Transport Protocol Benchmark Design](transport.md)

## Results

Eventually results of these benchmarks will be posted here.
