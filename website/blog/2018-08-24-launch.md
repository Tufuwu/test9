We are excited to announce Bowler, the safe refactoring tool for modern Python!
We created Bowler as a tool for building powerful and reusable code mods for all of the
Python services and utilities that we've created at Facebook.  This tool has already
proved useful in upgrading old code to new APIs, fixing broken attributes in build
rules, and in making these changes trivial to repeat in production.

Bowler is built using syntax trees from the Python standard library, enabling
compatibility with all past and future versions of Python. Bowler's fluent query API
allows you to build refactoring scripts from composable and reusable components that
can continue providing value into the future, rather than being thrown away or wasted.

As of today, we have made Bowler available in "early access" on [Github][], while we
continue to iterate on both the feature set and the API.  It's already quite useful
for common refactoring in a large code base, and we look forward to your feedback and
suggestions for how to improve Bowler in the future.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the documentation on [how Bowler works](/docs/basics-intro), or dive
into the [Query API](/docs/api-query).  If you're interested in making Bowler even
better, head over to the [contributors guide](/docs/dev-intro), or let us know on
[Twitter][].
