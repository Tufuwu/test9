## Pandas and Texthero.


## Introduction

- Pandas
- Texthero
- Unsupervised learning
- Dataset:

## Text representation

- TF-IDF
- Count
- Word2Vec

##  If it is due to identical points in the dataset, removing these points may help.


## Clustering

## Unsupervised
- k-means
- Totally Random Trees embedding

## Semi-supervised
- LDA

## Dimensionality reduction
To visualize the structure of a dataset, the dimension must be reduced somehow.

- PCA
- NCA
- Multi-dimensional Scaling, a technique used for analyzing similarity or dissimilarity data. It attempts to model dissimilarity or similarity of data as distance in a geometric vector spaces.
- t-sne
