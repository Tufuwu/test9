OpenSVC Windows Build survival guide
------------------------------------

Goal :
----
=> Deliver a single .exe installer with everything inside
=> Executable have to be upgradable

HowTo :
-----
=> install wix tools ( http://wixtoolset.org/ - known to work with 3.8, 3.11 )
=> install nsis ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ - known to work with 3.0a2, 3.03 )
=> install Visual C++ 2010 x86 redist files, needed by opensvc/bin/pkg/winbuilder/nmake.exe ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555 )
=> install coreutils package from Cygwin (check system PATH is updated with cygwin64\bin folder, you may need to manually set it up)
=> check that kits/vcredist content is OK (expected content is Visual C++ 2015 U1 x64 redist files, not the same file as previous point)
=> check that kits/winpython content is OK (expected content is a folder named "python" with a ready to use python distrib, cleaned winpython for example)
   - install Python from a binary distribution (like https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.7/python-3.6.7-amd64.exe)
   - install PyWin32 from a binary distribution (like https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases/download/b224/pywin32-224.win-amd64-py3.6.exe)
   - install PyCryptodome module using pip
      * install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 64 bits Community Edition with C/C++ compilers (default install)
      * pip install pycryptodome
      * python -m Crypto.SelfTest
   - copy the resulting python tree into kits/winpython, under a folder named "python"
=> launch a cmd.exe /V:ON to enable "delayed environment variable expansion"
=> go to folder opensvc\bin\pkg\winbuilder
=> check osvcvar.cmd is setting environment variables OSVCMAKEVERSION and OSVCMAKERELEASE
=> edit Makefile and verify/fix paths, validate with nmake.exe /N ( no execution, only macro interpretation )
=> give a try with nmake.exe, you should end up with a ready to use installer

Install :
-------
=> Graphical : Copy .exe to target host & double clic on the installer
=> Silent : Open a windows shell & launch installer with "/S" flag (uppercase)

Tunable Files :
-------------
=> osvcvar.cmd
=> Makefile
=> wxs/ExcludeList.txt : used to avoid copying temp/log/unwanted files in the final archive
=> wxs/opensvc.transform.xsl : used to modify xml stream produced by harvesting command heat.exe
=> wxs/OpenSVCproduct.wxs : Wix config file for OpenSVC msi package
=> nsis/opensvc.nsi : NSIS config file for EXE Bundle file (VC++ redist & Opensvc)
