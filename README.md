This is odonto - an [Opal](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) project.

To get started on test, run the following commands:

```
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    python manage.py create_test_users
```

The last command creates a super user called super, a dentist user and a nurse user.
