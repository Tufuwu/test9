## Installation

This project uses *Python 3.6.2*.

In order to clone the project and install required third-party packages please execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-stats.git
cd market-maker-stats
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For some known Ubuntu and macOS issues see the [pymaker](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker) README.


## Trade chart tools

These tools draw a chart with either the historical GDAX ETH/USD price, the historical GDAX BTC/USD price,
or any other price which history has been archived in `streamer`, recent trades which took place with the keeper
(represented as blue or green dots) and all recent trades which took place on this specific market (represented
as pink dots). The size of the dots depends on the trade volume. This way we can clearly
spot if the keeper is not creating dangerous arbitrage opportunities.

In case of OasisDEX (the `oasis-market-maker-chart` tool), closest bids and asks will also be shown
in the chart (represented as lines).

Sample result for OasisDEX:

## Profitability calculation tools

These tools perform profitability calculation of ETH/DAI or BTC/DAI keepers.

Sample text output:

```
PnL report for DAI market-making:

## Trade history dumping tools

These tools export the list of recent trades which took place with the keeper, either as a text table
(if invoked with `--text`) or as a JSON document (if invoked with `--json`).

Taker address is only present for OasisDEX.

Example text output:

```
       Date/time          Type       Price       Amount in ETH   Value in DAI                      Taker
