# Themes

Each directory in this folder represents a different icon theme, grouped roughly as follows.

## Vibrant (Circle, Square)

Current Numix style; if you're submitting a contribution then you must cover its themes. Here are the [design guidelines](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/wiki/Guidelines) and below you can find groups of icons which use similar elements to help you along the way.

## Mono (uTouch, Shine)

Earlier Numix style; its themes are no longer actively supported. If you're submitting a contribution then you do not have to submit icons for these themes. These icons have square baseplates with a coloured background, overlayed with a white transparent effect (diamond lattice for uTouch, cut-through for Shine), and finally an all-white symbol.
