To use the list management stuff in this directory:

Install listadmin: sudo aptitude install listadmin
Save the password: echo 'password "password"' > listadmin.ini.local

When necessary, remove the cached list of lists: rm esp-lists.txt
When necessary, run listadmin: make

make will automatically download the current list of Mailman lists
from the server if you don't already have that list saved. (Note 
that this runs ls appropriately on esp.mit.edu using ssh, so you'll
either need your esp.mit.edu password, or have public keys or Kerberos
authentication set up.)

make will then run listadmin with a suitable configuration file.
Any changes you make will be logged into listadmin.log.
