Dear {{ user.first_name }},

Thank you for registering for Splash!  This is a preliminary confirmation email for your Splash registration; you can come back and change your classes and access online payment until registration closes on November 18th.  Here are some things you should know:

1. You may notice that your schedule has no room numbers on it.  The schedule you receive when you check in at Splash will have room numbers for your classes on it.

2. When you arrive at MIT for Splash, you can pay and pick up your schedule at check-in.  Starting at 8:00am on Saturday, Check-in will be in the Du Pont Gymnasium in Building W31 (http://whereis.mit.edu/?selection=W31&zoom=17).  Note that this is a different location from past years; we have moved to a larger room to accommodate all of you.

At 10:00am on Saturday, check-in will close for an hour so that we can move to Lobby 10 (http://whereis.mit.edu/?selection=10&zoom=17). Check-in will be in Lobby 10 starting from 11am and continuing through the remainder of Splash.

3. You can pre-order t-shirts, meal tickets, or photos online.  T-shirts, photos, and dinner tickets are $10; lunch tickets are $5.  Please note that if you receive financial aid, you get lunch tickets for both days for free.

4. If you have not yet paid and are not receiving financial aid, you can either pay by credit card online or at check-in by cash or check. The same goes if you want to order a t-shirt, a photo, or meal tickets.  If you have paid online, you will get into a faster line for check-in.

5. Thank you for registering!  Students are the lifeblood of our program, and we're thrilled that you can join us for what looks to be the biggest Splash! yet.
