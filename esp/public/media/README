Media setup instructions
------------------------

This directory contains all media files required for a generic ESP Web site.  Top level subdirectories of note include images, scripts, styles, and uploaded.

The media directories 'images' and 'styles' should be created as symbolic links to the actual directories 'default_images' and 'default_styles'.  This is an artifact of a previous (Dropbox-based) scheme for file customization that is no longer being used.  The symbolic links will be removed in a future release.

The entire directory tree may be edited by administrators through the admin interface:
    /admin/filebrowser/browse/
This the preferred method for customizing image files such as logos.

Some of the files in this area are also written by the Web site itself.  For example, the themes system generates CSS stylesheets and writes image files and scripts particular to the selected theme.  It can be accessed by administrators at:
    /themes/
