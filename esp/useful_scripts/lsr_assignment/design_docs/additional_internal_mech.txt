1) Paul's sanity sweep: for each class, see if there are fewer priority flags
than enrollment size, if there are, enroll all of the priorities.  Do this for
every class.

2) Weighted probability enrollment: Each student starts with a valuation of 1*,
divide by 2* for every priority class the student is already enrolled in.
Starting with the smallest class with unresolved priority-level conflicts,
enroll by weighted probability over interested students.  Do this for every
class.

3) Screwed Sweep: list students by number of priority classes accepted to out of
number of priorities indicated.  If a fraction is below ~1/3, review and attempt
to hand-fix.

4) Large sanity sweep: Sort classes by number of students who checked
interested.  Starting with the class the fewest students interested in, fill
classes to capacity* (capacity* = capacity-10% for classes with 30 or more max
enrollment).  When there is conflict over capacity* delay the class (send it to
the back of the queue). When a full cycle of delays occurs, move to step 5.

5) Weighted probability enrollment phase 2.  Starting with the final stage
valuations from step 2 (1* divided by 2* for every enrolled priority class) ,
use a parallel process to (2) dividing by 2** for every non-priority class the
student is enrolled in. In the order from step 4 (smallest interest) enroll by
the new and simultaneously adjusting weighted probabilities.

6) Screwed sweep Two: look for students with lots of blank periods and look at
students with an empty class period, and how many courses they checked in that
period.  (if a lot of either case, hand-fix, filling into the 10% of adjustment
space left by Step 4)

7?) Screwing over everyone else and removing wiggle room to prevent squabble, or
is squabble better?  Remove the 10% capacity constraint and enroll students with
as-of-yet vacant schedule slots starting with the classes with the most space
remaining and using adjusting weighted probabilities from 5 (1* divided by 2*
for every enrolled priority class and 2** for every other enrolled class)

1* = 1 but may be adjusted to a slightly larger constant to reflect a student
who has selected a lot of classes in a lot of time blocks (example
1*1.1(#periods student selects at least 5 classes).  In lieu of adjusting this
value, there is control-preference for students with a small set of indicated
interest.
2* is a value between 1 and 2
2** is a smaller value between 1 and 2
