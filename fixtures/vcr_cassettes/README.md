# VCR Recordings for openstax-cms
These are VCR cassettes to record interactions with Salesforce.
If you need to change a test that interacts with these, you can remove the affected yaml file and rerun the tests, 
this will regenerate the API interaction. 

**Be sure to remove any usernames or passwords from the file before checking them in.**
