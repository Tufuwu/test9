Adhocracy 4 Changelog
=====================

Development
-----------

 - First preview release
 - All inline scripts were removed. Instead, we now use placeholder elements
   with a `data-a4-widget' attribute that you should use to manually initialize
   comment, follow, rating, and report widgets.
 - Collapsible RichText fields are introduced and used for Project.information.
   Projects derived from adhocracy4 have to add the collapsible-image-editor
   config to BLEACH_LIST and CKEDITOR_CONFIGS.
 - Introducing DistinctOrderingFilter to ensure that every queryset gets
   a distinct ordering
 - adding API calls to /moderatorremarks/ to api.js
