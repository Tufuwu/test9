        <p>welcome to our humble (and slightly strange) little part of the World Wide Web. Let me give you a quick introduction about what you've stumbled upon here.</p>

        <p>pygame (the library) is a Free and Open Source <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> programming language library for making multimedia applications like games.</p>

        <p>pygame.org (the website) welcomes all Python game, art, music, sound, video and multimedia projects. Once you have finished <a href="/wiki/GettingStarted">getting started</a> you could <a href="/members/projects/new">add a new project</a> or learn <a href="/wiki/about">about</a> pygame by reading the <a href="/docs/">docs</a>. For more information on what is happening in the pygame world see the <a href="/dashboard">community dashboard</a> web page, which lists many things like our projects we are working on, news (our blog with rss), <a href="https://twitter.com/pygame_org">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame">reddit</a> (forum), <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pygame">stackoverflow</a> (Q&amp;A), <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/">Bitbucket</a> (development), <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/pygame">irc</a>(chat), <a href="/wiki/info">mailinglist</a> (we love writing electronic mail to each other) and other various bits and pieces about pygame from around the internets.</p>

        <p>pygame (the community) is a small volunteer group of creative humans who &#9829; making things (there may also be a few cats, several koalas, dozens of doggos, 3.14 gnomes, and 42 robots who also tinker amongst us). We respect each other, and follow the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python community code of conduct</a>, whilst we help each other make interesting things.</p>

        <p>Enjoy yourself whilst looking around. We look forward to your creations.</p>

        <p><br>Best humanly possible wishes and extra toasty warm regards,<br/>pygame</p>

        <p><small>ps. We spell colour without the u (sorry), and we always spell pygame with lower case letters. Also, please do excuse the mess - we're doing some renovations around here you see.</small></p>
