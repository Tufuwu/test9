Development
==========

## How to get started

Since you clicked the link to get here, you most likely are a developer with C/C++ knowledge and wonder how to start contributing to the Geany project? You will find a short introduction here on how to start.

### Introduce yourself

The first step is to introduce yourself so that we know you are there. Begin with subscribing to the [mailing lists][1] if you haven't done yet. Then write us a short mail to the [Geany Devel mailing list][2] and introduce yourself. We do not require any specific information about you. You decide what you will tell us.

### Prepare for developing

#### Read the HACKING file

Before you begin hacking on Geany, you should have a look on the [HACKING][3] file. Important things about coding style and many more are written down there.

#### Surf through bugs and feature requests

There is a [bug tracker][4] which may contain bug reports or even feature requests which may already have a patch attached. To avoid redundant efforts, it's always a good idea to have a look first to see if there is already anything concerning the topic you want to work on.

#### Surf through the mailing lists

There are also mailing lists archives where you can find out if topics have already been discussed. It's a good idea, to have at least a quick look there too. You can find them on the [mailing lists page][5].

### Step in and dive into the Geany project

There are a few different points where you can step in and begin developing and improving Geany.

#### Fix bugs

You can fix any bug you found in the [issue tracker][4] and either send a patch to the Geany-devel mailing list or attach the patch directly to the concerning bug. If you have an account om GitHub, you may also fork us and open a pull request accordingly.

#### Add new features

Take a feature you found on the issue tracker and decide if it is a feature which should be implemented in the Geany core or if it is better that it is implemented as a plugin. If you're not sure, you can discuss this on the Geany-devel mailing list. When you have decided to implement the feature in the Geany core, go ahead and clone or update the [current Git master of Geany][6], implement your feature and open a pull request on GitHub.

#### Write a plugin

Write your own plugin? Yes!
More information about the separate Geany-Plugins project can be found on the [plugins page][7].

If you're going to write a plugin it would be cool if you write your README file in restructuredText. It can automagically be used for the plugins.geany.org website then.


### Dive deeper

When you like contributing to the Geany project and have fun with implementing things for Geany, you can even dive deeper.

#### Fork us on GitHub

You can find Geany on GitHub at https://github.com/geany. A repository for Geany-Plugins can also be found there. Feel free to anonymously clone the repositories, change the code, diff it and send us the patches or even better - if you have an account at GitHub - fork it there and open a pull request for your changes.
