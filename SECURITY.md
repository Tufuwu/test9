# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is an overview of the security support status of aioxmpp
releases. For the supported versions, we provide backports of security
relevant patches ASAP after we become aware of them.

**Note:** Distributors of aioxmpp may also support older versions.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 0.10.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.10.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can send a GPG encrypted message to the
main maintainer of aioxmpp, [Jonas SchÃ¤fer](mailto:jonas@wielicki.name).
The GPG key ID is 0xE5EDE5AC679E300F (full fingerprint: AA5A 78FF 508D
8CF4 F355  F682 E5ED E5AC 679E 300F).

If you prefer to report vulnerabilities publicly right away, you can do
so like you would report normal issues; that is, here on GitHub, in our
chat room or on the mailing list (see the README for details).

When you report a security vulnerability, we will handle it with the
highest priority and work, possibly with you, to create a fix. Please
provide as much information as possible in the initial report so that
we can get to the core of the issue right away.

We will keep you posted on progress of fixing the issue via a
communication channel we negotiate when you first report it.
