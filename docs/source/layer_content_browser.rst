Layer Content Browser
---------------------

Uses `sdffilter`_ to display content from USD layers (regardless of format or if they have been saved on disk).

Array attributes and time samples have their contents reduced to a maximum of 6 entries.

The following example browses the contents of the layers that modify the ``displayColor`` property of the ``ChairB_2`` (as presented on :ref:`Setting an Edit Target`).

The ``Layer Content Browser`` widget can be opened from the USDView ``Composition`` tab (as shown above), as well as from the layer tree of the :ref:`Layer Stack Composition` widget:
