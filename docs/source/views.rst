Views (``durin.views``)
================================

Durin provides four views that handle token management for you.

--------------------------

LoginView
--------------------------

.. autoclass:: durin.views.LoginView
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

Response Data and User Serialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the endpoint authenticates a request, a JSON object will be returned
containing the ``token`` as a string, ``expiry`` as a timestamp for when
the token expires.

This is because ``USER_SERIALIZER`` setting is ``None`` by default.

If you wish to return custom data upon successful authentication
like ``first_name``, ``last_name``, and ``username`` then the included ``UserSerializer``
class can be used inside ``REST_DURIN`` settings by adding :class:`durin.serializers.UserSerializer`.

Obviously, if your app uses a custom user model that does not have these fields,
a custom serializer must be used.

Client Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most cases, you would want to customize how the login view gets the 
client object to associate with the token. By default, it is the ``client`` attribute in POSTed request body. 
Here's an example snippet of how you can override this behaviour::

        ### views.py:

        from durin.models import Client as APIClient
        from durin.views import LoginView as DurinLoginView

        class LoginView(DurinLoginView):

            @staticmethod
            def get_client_obj(request):
                # get the client's name from a request header
                client_name = request.META.get("X-my-personal-header", None)
                if not client_name:
                    raise ParseError("No client specified.", status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
                return APIClient.objects.get_or_create(name=client_name)


        ### urls.py:

        from durin import views as durin_views
        from yourapp.api.views import LoginView

        urlpatterns = [
            url(r'login/', LoginView.as_view(), name='durin_login'),
            url(r'refresh/', durin_views.RefreshView.as_view(), name='durin_refresh'),
            url(r'logout/', durin_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='durin_logout'),
            url(r'logoutall/', durin_views.LogoutAllView.as_view(), name='durin_logoutall'),
        ]

--------------------------

RefreshView
--------------------------

.. autoclass:: durin.views.RefreshView
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

--------------------------

LogoutView
--------------------------

.. autoclass:: durin.views.LogoutView
   :show-inheritance:

--------------------------

LogoutAllView
--------------------------

.. autoclass:: durin.views.LogoutAllView
   :show-inheritance:

.. Note:: It is not recommended to alter the Logout views. They are designed 
          specifically for token management, and to respond to durin authentication.
          Modified forms of the class may cause unpredictable results.
