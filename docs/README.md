# Documentation

## Building

Building the documentation requires sphinx:

    # debian/ubuntu
    $ apt-get install python-sphinx
    # arch
    $ pacman -S python-sphinx
    # generic
    $ pip install sphinx

Once sphinx is installed (verify with `which sphinx-build`), it can be
built using the Makefile:

    cd docs
    make

This will create html documentation under `docs/_build/html/`.

## Structure

The documentation is structured as follows:

* `conf.py` - sphinx configuration, imports the `globus_sdk` package to
  use in autodoc directives and to get the package version
* `index.rst` - homepage, contains basic example and links to other docs
* `Makefile` - simplifies building the documentation in various formats.
   autogenerated by sphinx-quickstart, tweaked to make html the default action

In general most of the documentation should be in docstrings. Using
curated `rst` files instead of the `sphinx-apidoc` command allows us to
customize the structure, while still allowing most of the documentation
to be automatically generated.
