Open Zaak Documentation
=======================

**Open Zaak** is a modern, open-source data- and services-layer to enable
`zaakgericht werken`_, a Dutch alternative to case management. Open Zaak offers
structured data storage and services that implement the `VNG standards for
"API's voor Zaakgericht werken"`_ in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.
