    "To follow along and run the code in this notebook, you'll need to clone the `ricecooker` repository, crate a virtual environement, install `ricecooker` using `pip install ricecooker`, install Jypyter notebook using `pip install jupyter`, then start the jupyter notebook server by running `jupyter notebook`. You will then be able to run all the code sections in this notebook and poke around."
