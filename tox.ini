# NOTES:
# * We avoid the new dependency resolver by pinning pip < 20.3, see
#   https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9187
# * Pinning dependencies requires tox >= 3.2.0, see
#   https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#conf-requires
# * It is also necessary to pin virtualenv as a newer virtualenv would still
#   lead to fetching the latest pip in the func* tox targets, see
