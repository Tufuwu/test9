	abstract = {In this paper, a novel kriging-based multi-fidelity method is
	            proposed. Firstly, the model uncertainty of low-fidelity and
	            high-fidelity models is quantified. On the other hand, the
	            prediction uncertainty of kriging-based surrogate models(SM) is
	            confirmed by its mean square error. After that, the integral
	            uncertainty is acquired by math modeling. Meanwhile, the SMs are
	            constructed through data from low-fidelity and high-fidelity
	            models. Eventually, the low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF)
	            SMs with integral uncertainty are obtained and a proposed fusion
	            algorithm is implemented. The fusion algorithm refers to the
	            Kalman filter's idea of optimal estimation to utilize the
	            independent information from different models synthetically.
	            Through several mathematical examples implemented, the fused SM
	            is certified that its variance is decreased and the fused
	            results tend to the true value. In addition, an engineering
	            example about autonomous underwater vehicles' hull design is
	            provided to prove the feasibility of this proposed multi-
	            fidelity method in practice. In the future, it will be a helpful
	            tool to deal with reliability optimization of black-box problems
	            and potentially applied in multidisciplinary design
	            optimization.},

	abstract = {Surrogate models or metamodels are commonly used to exploit
	            expensive computational simulations within a design optimization
	            framework. The application of multi-ﬁdelity surrogate modeling
	            approaches has recently been gaining ground due to the potential
	            for further reductions in simulation eﬀort over single ﬁdelity
	            approaches. However, given a black box problem when exactly
	            should a designer select a multi-ﬁdelity approach over a single
	            ﬁdelity approach and vice versa? Using a series of analytical
	            test functions and engineering design examples from the
	            literature, the following paper illustrates the potential
	            pitfalls of choosing one technique over the other without a
	            careful consideration of the optimization problem at hand. These
	            examples are then used to deﬁne and validate a set of guidelines
	            for the creation of a multi-ﬁdelity Kriging model. The resulting
	            guidelines state that the diﬀerent ﬁdelity functions should be
	            well correlated, that the amount of low ﬁdelity data in the
	            model should be greater than the amount of high ﬁdelity data and
	            that more than 10\% and less than 80\% of the total simulation
	            budget should be spent on low ﬁdelity simulations in order for
	            the resulting multi-ﬁdelity model to perform better than the
	            equivalent costing high ﬁdelity model.},

                levels of analysis are available, using an extension to the
                geostatistical method of co-kriging. An exchange algorithm is

                computational ‘noise’ in the multiple levels of analysis. A
                multi-fidelity wing optimization is used to demonstrate the
